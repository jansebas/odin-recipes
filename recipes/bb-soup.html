        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When you don't feel like cooking, this is the recipe for you. You can get a warm, filling, perfectly-spiced bowl of soup on the table in 20 minutes, 1 pot, and very minimal 
            effort. A little garlic and an onion, some tomato paste, broth, and ground cumin are all you need to turn a few cans of black beans into your new favorite busy weeknight meal.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Tbsp <strong>olive oil</strong></li>
            <li>1 medium <strong>yellow onion</strong>, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves <strong>garlic</strong>, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup <strong>tomato paste</strong></li>
            <li>1 tsp ground <strong>cumin</strong></li>
            <li>3 <em>15 oz</em> cans <strong>black beans</strong> (2 cans with liquid, 1 can drained)</li>
            <li>2 cups <strong>vegetable broth</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Garnish</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Chopped fresh <strong>cilantro</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Sour cream</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Hot sauce</strong></li>
            <li>Diced <strong>avocado</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add yellow onion and garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the onions are turning translucent.</li>
            <li>Add tomato paste and ground cumin. Cook, stirring for 1-2 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Add black beans and vegetable broth. Bring to a boil then lower to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes (up to 30 for deeper flavor), stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Use an immersion blender to puree the soup a few times. You don't want to completely blend the soup, just thicken it up. You can also pour 1 cup into a blender and puree it, 
                then return it to the pot.
            </li>
            <li>Serve garnished to taste with sour cream, fresh cilantro, avocado, and a dash of hot sauce. May also be served with tortilla chips.</li>
        </ol>
